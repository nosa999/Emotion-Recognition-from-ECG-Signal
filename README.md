ECG Emotion Recognition: Classifying Emotions with CNN on “Case” Dataset (Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion)

This code is for classifying emotions from Ecg signal which recorded from participants while watching four different types of videos as a emotion stimulation. The videos include amusing, boring, relaxing, and scaring types. This code gets the Ecg signals as input and classify them in four types classes. We used a three layers Convolution Neural Network For our classification model.
